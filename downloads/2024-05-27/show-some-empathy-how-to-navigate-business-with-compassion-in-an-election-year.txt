Amidst the pursuit of profit and success, we often forget that behind every transaction, negotiation, and decision lies a person — someone with dreams, struggles, and a complex tapestry of emotions. I have always said that at its core, all business is by and between human beings. Image File Photo Nancy Marshall, Marshall Communications As we brace ourselves for the upcoming election, the stakes are high, and the spotlight on societal issues is glaring. With hateful comments callously posted on social media every minute of every day, political polarization is at its peak, and conversations are charged with intensity. In the current environment, it's critical, now more than ever, to embrace empathy in our business dealings. var rand_val = Math.floor((Math.random() * 1000) + 1); var adId_ad_1 = "avp_zid_"+rand_val; if ( typeof count_ad_1 == 'undefined' ) { count_ad_1 = 0; } document.getElementsByClassName('advert-article-div-ad-1')[count_ad_1++].setAttribute('id',adId_ad_1); _avp.push({ tagid: adId_ad_1, alias: '/', type: 'banner', zid: 170, pid: 0 }); Why empathy? Behind peoples’ facade of success, wealth, and beauty lies a world of untold stories. Every individual we encounter in business, no matter how gorgeous, wealthy, thin and successful they may seem on the outside, is fighting battles we know nothing about. It's easy to envy the seemingly flawless facade of a successful entrepreneur or a high-profile executive, but it's essential to remember that appearances can be deceiving. We are all human, and humans have problems. People may have a hidden illness, a child who is suicidal, a parent who cannot stay alone in their home, or a drug and alcohol addiction that you might never suspect. They may have unmanageable debt or a neighbor who is spying on them with a drone camera. You just don’t know. And many people don’t want to reveal what’s going on behind the scenes. Thankfully, I have become much more empathetic as I’ve gotten older and I’ve learned how to establish connections with others based on trust, caring and concern. In my younger life, I was strident and sometimes even abrasive in my quest to get ahead in business. Someone called me a "human bulldozer" when I was in my twenties because I just wanted to get things done on my to-do list, but didn’t stop and think how I made people feel. var rand_val = Math.floor((Math.random() * 1000) + 1); var adId_ad_1 = "avp_zid_"+rand_val; if ( typeof count_ad_1 == 'undefined' ) { count_ad_1 = 0; } document.getElementsByClassName('advert-article-div-ad-1')[count_ad_1++].setAttribute('id',adId_ad_1); _avp.push({ tagid: adId_ad_1, alias: '/', type: 'banner', zid: 171, pid: 0, inview: true }); I learned from Maya Angelou’s famous quote, “People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but they will never forget how you made them feel.” It took me decades to gain the emotional intelligence required to stop and think about how I made people feel. In the cutthroat business world, losing sight of our shared humanity is easy. But empathy is the bridge that connects us, allowing us to understand and relate to one another on a deeper level. When we empathize with our colleagues, clients, and competitors, we create a culture of trust, respect, and collaboration. Empathy isn't just a moral imperative; it's also a smart business strategy. Studies have shown that companies with a strong culture of empathy outperform their peers in terms of employee satisfaction, customer loyalty, and overall profitability. By fostering a workplace where empathy is valued and practiced, organizations can unleash the full potential of their teams and cultivate a competitive edge in the market. But empathy shouldn't be confined to the boardroom; it should permeate every aspect of our lives, especially as we navigate the turbulent waters of an election year. In a time marked by divisiveness and discord, kindness, compassion, and empathy are our most potent tools for building bridges and fostering understanding. As we engage in political discourse and debate, we must remember that behind every policy position and ideological stance lies a person with deeply held beliefs and convictions. Instead of resorting to personal attacks or demonizing those who disagree with us, let's try to listen with an open heart and mind, seeking to understand the perspectives of others even when they differ from ours. var rand_val = Math.floor((Math.random() * 1000) + 1); var adId_ad_1 = "avp_zid_"+rand_val; if ( typeof count_ad_1 == 'undefined' ) { count_ad_1 = 0; } document.getElementsByClassName('advert-article-div-ad-1')[count_ad_1++].setAttribute('id',adId_ad_1); _avp.push({ tagid: adId_ad_1, alias: '/', type: 'banner', zid: 172, pid: 0, inview: true }); The principles of empathy are equally applicable in business. Whether negotiating a deal, resolving a conflict, or leading a team, empathy allows us to see beyond the surface and connect with the humanity of those around us. It's about recognizing that everyone has struggles, insecurities, and vulnerabilities, regardless of how successful or affluent they appear. Moreover, empathy fosters a culture of inclusivity and belonging, where every voice is heard and valued. In an Election Year fraught with tension and polarization, let's strive to create spaces where diversity of thought is celebrated and differing perspectives are welcomed with open arms. Of course, practicing empathy isn't always easy, especially in the heat of the moment when emotions run high and tensions flare. But it's precisely during these challenging times that empathy becomes most critical. It's about taking a step back, breathing deeply, and responding with grace and compassion, even in the face of adversity. As we navigate the complexities of business and politics in the year ahead, let's remember that empathy isn't a sign of weakness; it's a source of strength. By cultivating empathy in our interactions and decision-making processes, we can build a more just, equitable, and harmonious world — one where kindness, compassion, and understanding prevail. As we head into the heat of the election season, let's embrace empathy as our guiding principle in business and politics. Let's strive to see humanity in each other, to listen with empathy, and to act with compassion. var rand_val = Math.floor((Math.random() * 1000) + 1); var adId_ad_1 = "avp_zid_"+rand_val; if ( typeof count_ad_1 == 'undefined' ) { count_ad_1 = 0; } document.getElementsByClassName('advert-article-div-ad-1')[count_ad_1++].setAttribute('id',adId_ad_1); _avp.push({ tagid: adId_ad_1, alias: '/', type: 'banner', zid: 170, pid: 0 }); Ultimately, it's not just about maximizing profits or winning elections; it's about creating a world where empathy reigns supreme and every individual is seen, heard and valued. _avp.push({ tagid: 'ugVBoW', alias: '/', type: 'banner', zid: 167, pid: 0, inview: true }); Read Previous The Lobster Institute at UMaine has a new executive director Read Next Bangor Savings Bank adds to its wealth management group Sign up for Enews _avp.push({ tagid: 'scl7kt', alias: '/', type: 'banner', zid: 163, pid: 0 }); _avp.push({ tagid: 'zJHoNs', alias: '/', type: 'banner', zid: 165, pid: 0 }); _avp.push({ tagid: 'k2M9Kc', alias: '/', type: 'banner', zid: 164, pid: 0, inview: true }); Most Recent $33M in federal funds will help clean up contamination at 13 Maine sites Friday Food Insider: Mr. Tuna opens the doors at East End site in Portland Evergreen Credit Union hires VP of 'member experience and engagement' _avp.push({ tagid: 'bl9Qyh', alias: '/', type: 'banner', zid: 175, pid: 0, inview: true }); var _avp = _avp || []; _avp.push({ tagid: 'lErux4', alias: '/', type: 'banner', zid: 176, pid: 0, inview: true }); _avp.push({ tagid: 'cE4ALa', alias: '/', type: 'banner', zid: 166, pid: 0, inview: true }); _avp.push({ tagid: 'pyRCxu', alias: '/', type: 'banner', zid: 177, pid: 0, inview: true }); Most Recent Bangor property revaluation is expected to take two years How a rural library is working to build connectivity for its community 'Squirrel Week' is no laughing matter for this utility company _avp.push({ tagid: 'jJ6atx', alias: '/', type: 'banner', zid: 173, pid: 0, inview: true }); Related Content Portland pro soccer team unveils name and branding, starts selling merch From craft beer to lobster: 10 Maine consumer brands with staying power Life in the fast lane: Mainers recall what car they were driving in 1994 Clam chowder beer, magic unicorns: Maine companies almost got us on April Fools' Day 0 Comments Write a Comment Cancel Comment if (!document.cookie || document.cookie.indexOf('shoutbox_hide') == -1) { _avp.push({ tagid: 'w9Z25r', alias: '/', type: 'banner', zid: 187, pid: 0, shoutbox: true, align: 'left', closeable: true, polite: true }); } Order a PDF The Giving Guide The Giving Guide helps nonprofits have the opportunity to showcase and differentiate their organizations so that businesses better understand how they can contribute to a nonprofit’s mission and work.
