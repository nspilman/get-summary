The Mainebiz Next List, presented annually since 2013, was designed to celebrate individuals who were changing the future of Maine’s economy. Some of them were on the young side, but not all. The list was more about the energy and vision they brought to the work ahead. Now in its second year, the Mainebiz NextUp: 40 Under 40 specifically recognizes Maine leaders who share that energy and vision as they rise in their careers. As you'll read, they come from a wide range of industries and professions. Please join Mainebiz in honoring this year's 40 Under 40 at a reception Wednesday, Nov. 8, from 5-7 p.m. The venue will be Brick South at Thompson's Point in Portland.
