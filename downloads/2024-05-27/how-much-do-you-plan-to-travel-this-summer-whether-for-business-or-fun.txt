Across the country, AAA projects 43.8 million people will head 50 miles or more from home during the holiday travel period, Thursday, May 23, through Monday, May 27. That number is a 4% increase over the total for Memorial Day 2023, and comes close to matching 2005’s record of 44 million Memorial Day travelers. The number of drivers this year will be up 4% compared to last year and 1.9% higher than in 2019, the motorist organization forecasts. Air travel is expected to surge even more, with 4.8% more passengers than last year and a whopping 9.3% increase over the 2019 total.
