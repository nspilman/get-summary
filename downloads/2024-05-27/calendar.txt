Women's Business Center 8:00am - 9:00am Online via Zoom, 30 Federal St, Brunswick, Maine, 04011 Do you want to own your own business? Are you helping to transition a family-owned business? We need Small Businesses in our communities. The retention of successful and established small businesses is critical to healthy rural communities. They provide employment and circulate three times more money back into local communities than absentee-owned businesses and corporate chains. When businesses close in rural areas, everyone loses. Small towns lose their services, plus the economic and social drivers that make them desirable places to live. Workers, especially young ones, lose their jobs and move elsewhere. Do you want to be a part of the solution? We all try to buy locally, but what about buying a local business? Let’s discuss the ins and outs of acquiring or transferring small businesses. Martha Bentley is the founder of Proprietor, a membership community centered on supporting, acquiring or transferring entrepreneurs at all stages of their journeys. She will share a little about what she has learned and lead a discussion on business ownership transition options. Join us to share, to listen, to learn in this safe forum for conversation!
