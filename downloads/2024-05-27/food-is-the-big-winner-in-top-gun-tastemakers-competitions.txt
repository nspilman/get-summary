Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share via Email Print Article Add PDF to Cart Write a Comment By Laurie Schreiber A Brunswick oyster business has received honors from two statewide entrepreneurial competitions in as many weeks. Nor'Easter Oyster won the top prize of $25,000 in the Maine Center for Entrepreneurs' Top Gun Showcase, held last week during the Maine Entrepreneurs Summit. The oyster farming company was also one of nine companies from Maine’s food industry selected for grant prizes in Coastal Enterprises Inc.’s Tastemakers Initiative. Cash awards from a growing number of pitch competitions are just one piece of a much larger funding ecosystem. But they can play a vital, just-in-time role for small companies looking to buy that next piece of equipment, create a marketing message or provide competitive wages. var rand_val = Math.floor((Math.random() * 1000) + 1); var adId_ad_1 = "avp_zid_"+rand_val; if ( typeof count_ad_1 == 'undefined' ) { count_ad_1 = 0; } document.getElementsByClassName('advert-article-div-ad-1')[count_ad_1++].setAttribute('id',adId_ad_1); _avp.push({ tagid: adId_ad_1, alias: '/', type: 'banner', zid: 170, pid: 0 }); Top Gun The 2024 Top Gun competition featured the founders of 10 Maine startups, who pitched their companies before a panel of judges and a live audience of over 250 at Hannaford Hall on the University of Southern Maine campus in Portland The winning of the $25,000 prize, Nor'Easter Oyster, was co-founded by Jacqueline Clarke and Sean Corcoran. It's an aquaculture business working to create a new market for Maine oysters. The win came after Clarke and Corcoran emerged as first-place winners at the Lewiston Auburn Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce’s 8th annual Top Gun LA Regional Pitch-Off Competition earlier this month.

Tastemakers Initiative From Brunswick to Thorndike, there are scores of farmers, processors and other food businesses. For five years, many have received CEI Tastemaker Awards, with grants that can be spent on anything that supports their growth, such as new refrigeration, packaging machines and solar panels. This week, nine food harvesters and producers were selected for the initiative. Each will share a portion of a $225,000 grant to invest in growing their businesses. var rand_val = Math.floor((Math.random() * 1000) + 1); var adId_ad_1 = "avp_zid_"+rand_val; if ( typeof count_ad_1 == 'undefined' ) { count_ad_1 = 0; } document.getElementsByClassName('advert-article-div-ad-1')[count_ad_1++].setAttribute('id',adId_ad_1); _avp.push({ tagid: adId_ad_1, alias: '/', type: 'banner', zid: 172, pid: 0, inview: true }); Image PHOTO / COURTESY OF STEVE DENEEF Alicia Gaiero, operating Nauti Sisters Sea Farm, was one of nine food businesses that received a CEI Tastemaker Award this week. The recipients are: Atlantic Sea Farms , Biddeford: kelp processor. Founder Briana Warner is a 2020 Mainebiz Next List honoree. Crystal Spring Farm , Brunswick: organic produce farm. Gulf of Maine Inc. , Pembroke: marine life supply company. Hall Brook Farm , Thorndike: organic produce farm. Nauti Sisters Sea Farm , Belfast: oyster grower.

Spreading Good Inc. , Yarmouth: maker of spreads and dips. The Holy Donut Inc . , various locations: donut maker. The company opened its newest location in Brunswick earlier this month. “The CEI Tastemakers Initiative Grant will help us acquire the equipment necessary to bring our next line of upcycled healthy snacks to market,” said Ben Slayton, co-founder of Spreading Good Inc. in Yarmouth, the maker of a brand of spreads called Harvest Maine. “With help from the University of Maine Food Innovation Center, we are prototyping a fruit snack made from the remains of apple cider pressing, or pomace.” The goal is to launch the product in late summer. “This timely grant will help us fit out our production facility with some new equipment, which will enable more efficient processing of our fruit snacks,” said Slayton. var rand_val = Math.floor((Math.random() * 1000) + 1); var adId_ad_1 = "avp_zid_"+rand_val; if ( typeof count_ad_1 == 'undefined' ) { count_ad_1 = 0; } document.getElementsByClassName('advert-article-div-ad-1')[count_ad_1++].setAttribute('id',adId_ad_1); _avp.push({ tagid: adId_ad_1, alias: '/', type: 'banner', zid: 170, pid: 0 }); Awardees are established food and beverage companies intending to increase production capacity, with “shovel-ready” projects that directly support Maine agriculture, aquaculture or fisheries as part of their supply chain. Phoenix O’Brien, co-owner of Hall Brook Farm in Thorndike, said the grant will allow the company to invest in equipment to produce more food in less space while creating more jobs on the farm. “It is also allowing us to increase efficiency in our greenhouse tomatoes to better supply our current markets," said O’Brien. The awardees have expressed commitments to sustainability as environmental factors disrupt the processes of food production, including planting, growing and harvesting. Seth Kroeck, the farm manager at Crystal Spring Farm, said the award will allow the farm to pursue production development resources, with a goal of creating a new fresh produce product line. var rand_val = Math.floor((Math.random() * 1000) + 1); var adId_ad_1 = "avp_zid_"+rand_val; if ( typeof count_ad_1 == 'undefined' ) { count_ad_1 = 0; } document.getElementsByClassName('advert-article-div-ad-1')[count_ad_1++].setAttribute('id',adId_ad_1); _avp.push({ tagid: adId_ad_1, alias: '/', type: 'banner', zid: 171, pid: 0, inview: true }); “Having new products to offer increases sales with our current accounts and diversifies our offerings, making it easier to get in the door with new customers,” said Kroeck. The awardees contribute to agriculture and aquaculture, both of which help fuel the restaurant sector and food retail industry in Maine and beyond. “This year’s Tastemakers are representative of the diversity and tenacity necessary to drive Maine’s economy forward,” said Bradley Russell, CEI’s director of sustainable agriculture and food systems program. “The success of Maine’s food system relies on the success of local businesses that are willing to do that hard work of committing to sustainability and scaling their business for success.” Now in its fifth year, the Tastemakers Initiative is a partnership between CEI and FocusMaine with the goal of supporting the growth of Maine’s food economy. _avp.push({ tagid: 'anFuu1', alias: '/', type: 'banner', zid: 167, pid: 0, inview: true }); Read Previous Avesta to unveil $7M affordable housing development in Scarborough Read Next Maine to get another 'lighthouse' this summer Sign up for Enews _avp.push({ tagid: 'jStkyy', alias: '/', type: 'banner', zid: 163, pid: 0 }); _avp.push({ tagid: 'jj6zlL', alias: '/', type: 'banner', zid: 165, pid: 0 }); _avp.push({ tagid: 'agAdDp', alias: '/', type: 'banner', zid: 164, pid: 0, inview: true }); Most Recent $33M in federal funds will help clean up contamination at 13 Maine sites Friday Food Insider: Mr. Tuna opens the doors at East End site in Portland Evergreen Credit Union hires VP of 'member experience and engagement' _avp.push({ tagid: 'hfCJ8G', alias: '/', type: 'banner', zid: 175, pid: 0, inview: true }); var _avp = _avp || []; _avp.push({ tagid: 'vmbprn', alias: '/', type: 'banner', zid: 176, pid: 0, inview: true }); _avp.push({ tagid: 'sxNl1I', alias: '/', type: 'banner', zid: 166, pid: 0, inview: true }); _avp.push({ tagid: 'p8IYOd', alias: '/', type: 'banner', zid: 177, pid: 0, inview: true }); Most Recent Bangor property revaluation is expected to take two years How a rural library is working to build connectivity for its community 'Squirrel Week' is no laughing matter for this utility company _avp.push({ tagid: 'cSohnB', alias: '/', type: 'banner', zid: 173, pid: 0, inview: true }); Related Content Breaking barriers: Women entrepreneurs from diverse backgrounds get a boost in Maine Panel will focus on how to use the Maine brand to market locally produced food Startup starter kit: Central Maine business-pitch contest calendar fills up Maine scallop ambassadors journey to France for culinary exchange 0 Comments Write a Comment Cancel Comment if (!document.cookie || document.cookie.indexOf('shoutbox_hide') == -1) { _avp.push({ tagid: 'rOawvm', alias: '/', type: 'banner', zid: 187, pid: 0, shoutbox: true, align: 'left', closeable: true, polite: true }); } Order a PDF The Giving Guide The Giving Guide helps nonprofits have the opportunity to showcase and differentiate their organizations so that businesses better understand how they can contribute to a nonprofit’s mission and work.
