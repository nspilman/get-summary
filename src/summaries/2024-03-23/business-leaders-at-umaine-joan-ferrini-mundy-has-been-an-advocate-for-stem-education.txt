Joan Ferrini-Mundy, the University of Maine's president, has made significant contributions to STEM education since her tenure began in 2018. She has overseen the university during a period of notable growth, particularly in engineering and computing fields. Under her leadership, the university inaugurated the Ferland Engineering Education and Design Center, a $78 million facility designed to promote hands-on learning by situating labs and classrooms side-by-side. 

A key focus for Ferrini-Mundy is the integration of research and innovation throughout the University of Maine System, which includes seven universities and the University of Maine School of Law. Her role as vice chancellor of research and innovation complements her presidency by aiming to enhance the state's workforce development through promoting research and development.

The University of Maine seeks to include more women and diversify the fields of engineering and other STEM subjects, addressing the challenge through career education, internship opportunities, and mentorship. Ferrini-Mundy's own experiences in the male-dominated field of mathematics highlight the importance of this initiative.

Another innovative project Ferrini-Mundy has supported is the "Factory of the Future," which aims to revolutionize sustainable manufacturing through advanced research and learning experiences for students. This project will contribute to workforce development and skills training, aligning with Maine's employment needs.

Lastly, Ferrini-Mundy recognizes the need for continual fundraising and campus improvements to meet changing student expectations and foster innovation. New buildings and facilities, such as the recently opened athletic and educational structures, play a key role in attracting students and supporting the university's mission.

The University of Maine, under Joan Ferrini-Mundyâ€™s leadership, is focused on driving innovation, supporting statewide workforce development, and enhancing STEM education, all while maintaining a commitment to diversity and inclusivity within these fields.
