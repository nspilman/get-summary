Lisa DeSisto has been appointed as the new CEO of MaineToday Media (MTM) and publisher of several publications including The Portland Press Herald, Kennebec Journal, Morning Sentinel, MaineToday.com, The Coastal Journal, and Maine Sunday Telegram. Prior to this role, DeSisto served as the chief advertising officer for Boston Globe Media and as the general manager for Boston.com. She brings extensive experience from her 17 years at The Boston Globe, where she held various roles in marketing, digital product, and sales management. DeSisto, along with her husband Tim Padgett and their son, will be relocating from Wakefield, Massachusetts, to the Portland area. She aims to focus on strengthening print editions and leading the company towards a digital future by building on a foundation of quality journalism. Her appointment comes after the departure of interim CEO Neil Heyside, who had taken over following Richard Connor's resignation at the end of 2011. DeSisto's hiring has been well-received by MTM owner Donald Sussman and Guild President Tom Bell, and she will start her tenure in mid-November after concluding her responsibilities at Boston Globe Media.
