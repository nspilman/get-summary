["A superior court judge has confirmed the Westbrook Zoning Board of Appeals' decision that Pike Industries' quarrying operations in the Five Star Industrial Park in Westbrook are subject to the city council's upcoming zoning changes. This ruling, made by Superior Court Justice Thomas Humphrey, denies Pike Industries' claim that their operations should be exempt from any new zoning changes due to their long history of quarrying in the area since 1968 and the issuance of various permits by the city. Pike Industries had appealed the board's decision but faces the prospect of stricter zoning regulations that could impact its quarrying activities. Pike argued for an exemption based on historical operations and permits granted for blasting and construction. Idexx Laboratories, located adjacent to Pike's Spring Street Quarry, has announced a $50 million expansion, highlighting the growing tensions between industrial operations and other business interests in the area. The court will consider Pike’s claims related to equity later in the year.", "Lisa DeSisto has been appointed as the new CEO of MaineToday Media (MTM) and publisher of several publications including The Portland Press Herald, Kennebec Journal, Morning Sentinel, MaineToday.com, The Coastal Journal, and Maine Sunday Telegram.

The Biddeford store has already shut down as part of an initial closure of 10 underperforming stores. The Ellsworth location is set to close on November 13, resulting in the loss of jobs for 80 full- and part-time workers. These employees will have the opportunity to seek employment at other Lowe's locations. At the time of the report, it was unclear how many employees were affected by the Biddeford closure. \n\nThe closures are part of a broader effort by Lowe's to reduce its workforce by 1,950 jobs across 15 states. Lowe's President and CEO Robert Niblock stated that these actions are necessary to improve profitability and strengthen the company's financial position. In addition to the closures in Maine, three stores in New Hampshire, one in Massachusetts, and another in Rhode Island are also being closed. Despite these cuts, Lowe's plans to open approximately 25 new stores this year but will reduce the number of new stores it opens annually to between 10 and 15 starting in 2012."]
