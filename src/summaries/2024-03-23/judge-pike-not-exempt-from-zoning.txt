A superior court judge has confirmed the Westbrook Zoning Board of Appeals' decision that Pike Industries' quarrying operations in the Five Star Industrial Park in Westbrook are subject to the city council's upcoming zoning changes. This ruling, made by Superior Court Justice Thomas Humphrey, denies Pike Industries' claim that their operations should be exempt from any new zoning changes due to their long history of quarrying in the area since 1968 and the issuance of various permits by the city. Pike Industries had appealed the board's decision but faces the prospect of stricter zoning regulations that could impact its quarrying activities. Pike argued for an exemption based on historical operations and permits granted for blasting and construction. Idexx Laboratories, located adjacent to Pike's Spring Street Quarry, has announced a $50 million expansion, highlighting the growing tensions between industrial operations and other business interests in the area. The court will consider Pikeâ€™s claims related to equity later in the year.
