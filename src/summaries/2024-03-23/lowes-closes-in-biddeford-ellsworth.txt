National home improvement retailer Lowe's is closing its stores in Biddeford and Ellsworth as part of a nationwide downsizing effort, according to a report from the Bangor Daily News. The Biddeford store has already shut down as part of an initial closure of 10 underperforming stores. The Ellsworth location is set to close on November 13, resulting in the loss of jobs for 80 full- and part-time workers. These employees will have the opportunity to seek employment at other Lowe's locations. At the time of the report, it was unclear how many employees were affected by the Biddeford closure. 

The closures are part of a broader effort by Lowe's to reduce its workforce by 1,950 jobs across 15 states. Lowe's President and CEO Robert Niblock stated that these actions are necessary to improve profitability and strengthen the company's financial position. In addition to the closures in Maine, three stores in New Hampshire, one in Massachusetts, and another in Rhode Island are also being closed. Despite these cuts, Lowe's plans to open approximately 25 new stores this year but will reduce the number of new stores it opens annually to between 10 and 15 starting in 2012.
