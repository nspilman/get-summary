The article reports on the closure of Urban Farm Fermentory, a business focused on fermented products situated in Portland's East Bayside neighborhood. Eli Cayer, the founder and owner, has decided to cease the production and wholesale distribution of the company’s products, which were available in supermarkets like Whole Foods and Hannaford. Cayer cited insufficient sales and the loss of a significant customer base, particularly due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the main reasons for the closure. Before shutting down, the fermentory announced its closure on social media and celebrated its 14-year operation with a final event featuring music, art, and its fermented drinks.

Urban Farm Fermentory, established in 2010, was recognized for experimenting with locally sourced seasonal flavors. After deciding to close, Cayer sought a new tenant for the space, which will now be occupied by Blue Lobster Urban Winery. Blue Lobster, moving from its original location, plans to expand its production and offer a larger tasting room, more parking, and outdoor seating at the new site. The transition is seen as part of the broader change within the area’s business landscape.
