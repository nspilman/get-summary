Bath Iron Works has received a $22.7 million contract to continue providing planning yard services for the U.S. Navy's Zumwalt-class destroyers. This work includes design, material kitting, logistics, planning, and execution, with most activities occurring in Maine. The contract could reach a total value of $343.7 million and extend through 2029 if all options are exercised and funded by the Navy. The Zumwalt-class destroyers, which are 610 feet long, are the Navy's newest guided missile destroyers, designed for close-to-shore operations and land attacks. These ships feature a unique stealth design to minimize radar visibility. Bath Iron Works, a General Dynamics subsidiary with 6,600 employees, is responsible for supporting 76 surface combatants in the Navy fleet. The company also manages post-delivery maintenance and modernization for DDG 51-class destroyers. BIW President Charles Krugh expressed gratitude for the Navy's continued confidence in the company's capabilities.
