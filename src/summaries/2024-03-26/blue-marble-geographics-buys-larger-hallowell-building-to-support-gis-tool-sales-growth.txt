Blue Marble Geographics, a software company, has announced its plans to relocate to a larger office building in Hallowell this fall to accommodate its growth. The company, which specializes in affordable global mapping tools, purchased a 6,468-square-foot office space at 22 Carriage Lane for $819,000 from Wolfington Group LLC. This move will roughly double the companyâ€™s operating space from its current location. President Patrick Cunningham stated that the new space is necessary due to the tight fit for its approximately 30 employees and to allow for the hiring of an additional 10 employees over the next five years to support increasing sales of its software products. Blue Marble Geographics provides tools for government agencies and companies across various industries, such as oil and gas, mining, and academia, to create maps that offer features like distance and area calculations, line of sight calculations, spectral analysis, among others. The company attributes much of its growth to the Global Mapper tool, a cost-effective and user-friendly geographic information system (GIS) solution, which it acquired from another company several years ago.
