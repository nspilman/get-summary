The Good Table restaurant in Cape Elizabeth will reopen under new ownership this Thursday. The new owner, Casey Prentice, CEO and managing partner of the Prentice Organization, purchased the restaurant from its original family owners last October. The interior has been renovated, and Chef Matt Ginn has crafted a menu featuring elegant comfort food. Ginn, who grew up in Cape Elizabeth and opened Evo Kitchen + Bar in Portland for the Prentice Organization's hospitality group, designed the menu to feel homey and welcoming to all ages and dietary preferences. The menu draws inspiration from the types of food Ginn would serve in his own home, ranging from roast chicken to mac-and-cheese. The space is designed to resemble a Cape-style home, carrying over original photographs and decor elements. Prentice expressed a mix of excitement and nervousness about the reopening, aiming to maintain the original concept of great food at honest prices while injecting their own style. The menu also features desserts by Pastry Chef Georgia Macon, including a pudding pie and cookies made with malted milk. The Good Table, located at 527 Ocean House Road in Cape Elizabeth, will be open for reservations and walk-ins from Wednesday through Saturday, from 5-9 p.m.
