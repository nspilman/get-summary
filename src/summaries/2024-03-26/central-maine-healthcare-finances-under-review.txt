In September, Jeff Brickman became the CEO and President of Central Maine Healthcare (CMHC) in Lewiston, taking over from Peter E. Chalke. Brickman, who previously worked as an administrator for Colorado-based Centura Health, hired Kaufman Hall, an Illinois-based consulting firm, to devise a plan for addressing a significant budget shortfall faced by the hospital system during the past fiscal year. Although the specific amount of the shortfall has not been disclosed, CMHC had reported a profit of $9.8 million in fiscal year 2015. To help manage the financial challenges, Brickman appointed David Thompson, also from Centura Health, as the new chief financial officer, replacing Phil Morissette, who assumed the role of CMHC vice president of finance and controller. Central Maine Healthcare, one of the region's largest employers, encompasses Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston, hospitals in Rumford and Bridgton, the Dempsey Center, the Central Maine Heart and Vascular Institute, and several medical practices in central and western Maine.
