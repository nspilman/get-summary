The article focuses on Forbes ranking Portland as the "most livable" city in America. This accolade comes in light of the city's substantial income growth rate of 6.3% over the past five years, complemented by its cultural offerings, low crime and unemployment levels. Forbes' evaluation included metropolitan areas with populations exceeding 500,000, using data from sources like Moody's Economy.com, Sperling's Best Places, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The criteria for the ranking encompassed household income growth, cost of living, crime data, a leisure index, and unemployment statistics. Portland's exceptional performance in these areas placed it at the top ahead of other cities like Bethesda, Md.; Des Moines, Iowa; Stamford, Conn.; and Tulsa, Okla.
