Federal inspectors discovered that county corrections officers at the Riverview Psychiatric Center in Augusta used stun guns and handcuffs to subdue mentally ill patients. This finding, among others, could lead to the institution losing nearly $20 million in federal funding. The problematic actions were documented in a report from an unannounced visit in May, arising from employing county corrections officers in response to patient attacks. The hospital's operating budget, which is over half reliant on this federal funding, stands at risk starting September 2. Riverview Superintendent Mary Louise McEwen has confirmed the cessation of Taser use as of May 24, and the contract with Kennebec County for providing corrections officers ended shortly thereafter. A corrective plan has been submitted by the hospital to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is pending federal review and approval.
