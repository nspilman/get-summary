The article discusses the growth and development of MDI Biological Laboratory amid the pandemic. The laboratory has expanded its enrollment in graduate programs and increased its staffing due to a surge in activities and demands. MDI Bio Lab President Hermann Haller highlighted 2023 as a milestone year, noting enrollments in year-round graduate programs reached an all-time high of 24 students, up from nine in pre-pandemic years. The staffing levels also rose to 134 from 113 in 2022. To accommodate this growth, the lab renovated and winterized seven cottages and built a new student housing unit with five spacious suites, emphasizing the importance of a large laundry facility according to students.

Located in Bar Harbor, the MDI Bio Lab focuses on the science of aging and regeneration on its 100-acre campus. The lab's work is supported by federal research awards and philanthropy, with new federal research awards in 2023 totaling $7.5 million and the institute's budget growing from $15 million in 2022 to $16 million. The lab aims to host 15 research groups and employ 150 people by the end of the decade, along with expanding its training opportunities, which include summer fellowships for high school and college students. MDI Bio Lab leads the Maine IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE), a collaborative network that has provided hands-on research experience for over 2,600 undergraduates, 90% of whom have pursued further training and careers in science and medicine. The lab is committed to cutting-edge biomedical research and training the next generation of science leaders in Maine.
