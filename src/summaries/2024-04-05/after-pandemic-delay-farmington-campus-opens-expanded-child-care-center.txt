After a pandemic-related delay, an expanded child care center at the University of Maine's Farmington campus has opened. The Sweatt-Winter Child Care and Early Education Center has moved into a new 10,000-square-foot facility, doubling its previous space and now offering services for infants and toddlers. The project was funded by the University of Maine System and external sources, totaling $3.1 million. The facility includes well-lit classrooms, outdoor playgrounds, and spaces for infant care, supporting both families and student education in early childhood programs. The goal is to address the shortage of early childhood professionals in Maine by providing high-quality child care and education services.
