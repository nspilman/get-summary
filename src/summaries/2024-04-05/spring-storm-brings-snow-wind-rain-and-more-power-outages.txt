A spring storm in Maine brought heavy snow and high winds, causing widespread power outages. Central Maine Power reported close to 350,000 customers without power, with Cumberland and Androscoggin counties being the hardest hit. The storm resulted in damage caused by falling trees and limbs weighed down by wet snow and strong winds. CMP deployed numerous line and tree crews to address the fallen power lines. Some areas may not have power restored until early next week. Ski resorts welcomed the snowfall, while schools remained closed and the Portland Sea Dogs postponed their season opener.
