Maine power companies are preparing for another winter-like storm with heavy snow, strong winds, and rain expected to hit the state. Central Maine Power and Versant Power are making necessary arrangements to address downed trees, damaged lines, and potential electricity outages. The companies are securing additional line crews, inspecting transmission lines, and monitoring the forecast closely. Customers are advised to stay away from downed lines, unplug appliances, avoid using outdoor stoves for heating, and be prepared with essentials like water, food, flashlights, and a battery-operated radio in case of outages.
