Sea Meadow Marine, a nonprofit business incubator and marine business hub in Yarmouth, has received $790,000 in federal funds for major upgrades to support business expansion. The funds will be used for rebuilding infrastructure such as bulkheads, launch ramps, and water/sewer systems. The award, nominated by U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, aims to support businesses requiring marine access and educational opportunities at the working waterfront. Owned by the Sea Meadow Marine Foundation, the facility supports various businesses including aquaculture operations, boat builders, and recreational marine organizations. The upgrades will help save and create jobs, expand educational programs, and ensure the working waterfront's sustainability.
