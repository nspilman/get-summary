The University of Southern Maine (USM) recently celebrated a significant milestone in the construction of the Crewe Center for the Arts by holding a "topping off" ceremony. During this event, the final structural beam was placed into position on the building, marking a major step forward in its completion. The Crewe Center for the Arts is being constructed in partnership with Consigli Construction, with design contributions from Pfeiffer Partners Architects and Oak Point Associates. The center is named in honor of brothers Daniel and Bob Crewe, with significant founding donations coming from Daniel Crewe and other philanthropists.

The Crewe Center will be a 40,000-square-foot facility designed to support music teaching, learning, and performance, with a focus on expanding USM’s theater, dance, and visual arts programs into Portland. Features of the center include a 200-seat performance hall for various performances, an arts lab for recitals, a "great hall" gallery, a visual arts studio that will house the Kate Cheney Chappell ’83 Center for Book Arts, and outdoor spaces for concerts and a sculpture garden. The opening of the Crewe Center for the Arts is anticipated for fall 2025.

The project has received significant financial support, including a $10 million gift from Suzi Osher, the largest in the history of the USM Foundation, and another $6 million from the Crewe Foundation. Additional funding was provided by Governor Janet Mills and the Maine Legislature, alongside $20 million in philanthropic donations. Efforts are ongoing to raise $3.2 million for the next phase of the project, which aims to enrich the educational experience for USM faculty and students while benefiting Maine’s creative economy.
