Breeze Airways is set to expand its operations to Bangor this coming fall by introducing three flights to Florida. Service from Bangor International Airport to Orlando will start on October 3 with flights on Thursdays and Sundays, while flights to and from Tampa will begin on October 4, taking place on Mondays and Fridays. Additionally, seasonal flights connecting Bangor to Fort Myers are scheduled to start on October 5, with flights on Wednesdays and Saturdays. This expansion makes Breeze the fifth carrier to offer regular service at Bangor International Airport, joining Allegiant, American, Delta, and United. The introduction of these routes is part of a larger rollout of new services offered by Breeze Airways, including other cities like Dallas/Fort Worth, Lancaster, Lansing, and Pensacola. Breeze Airways, which commenced operations in 2021 and brands itself as "the nice low cost carrier," now operates over 170 year-round and seasonal nonstop routes between 56 cities across 29 states. The expansion into Bangor was announced alongside news of major upgrades at Bangor International Airport, including renovations to runways and terminals costing over $59 million, funded primarily through federal funds.
