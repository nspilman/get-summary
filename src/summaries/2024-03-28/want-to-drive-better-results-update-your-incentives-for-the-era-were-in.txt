The article emphasizes the importance of adapting employee incentive programs to address current workforce challenges. With rising employee demands and dissatisfaction, businesses are encouraged to look beyond traditional pay raises and bonuses. The authors, Mary Axelsen and Amy Wood of Human-Centered Leadership, highlight the significance of showing genuine care and listening to employees. They suggest four strategies to enhance employee engagement and retention:

1. **Value Self-Care and Relationships**: Recognizing the importance of regular breaks and social interactions for peak performance.
   
2. **Prioritize Results Over Process**: Emphasizing outcomes and allowing flexibility in how work is accomplished, recognizing the permanence of hybrid work models.
   
3. **Maintain Ongoing Communication**: Keeping open lines of communication with employees to address concerns proactively.
   
4. **Embrace Failure as a Learning Opportunity**: Encouraging a culture where mistakes are seen as chances for growth, which fosters innovation and retention.

By implementing these strategies, businesses can create a more supportive and productive work environment that understands and meets the needs of their employees in this post-pandemic era.
