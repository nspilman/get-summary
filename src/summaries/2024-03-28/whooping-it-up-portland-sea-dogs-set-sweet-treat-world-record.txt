The Portland Sea Dogs, a Double-A baseball team, set a world record for the "Longest Line of Whoopie Pies" with 2,121 whoopie pies, assembled outside Hadlock Field last June. The event, recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records, featured whoopie pies made by Wicked Whoopies of Freeport and arranged to represent a giant whoopie pie. Maine's official treat, often called a black moon, includes two mound-shaped pieces of cake with a creamy filling. The record was celebrated with an event hosted by Wicked Whoopies in downtown Freeport, highlighting Maine's contribution to the whoopie pie legacy. The record-setting evening also saw the Sea Dogs play as the Maine Whoopie Pies against the Akron (Ohio) Rubber Ducks, continuing an alternate identity tradition. Attendees received whoopie pies as they left the game. The Sea Dogs plan to host another Maine Whoopie Pie Night on June 7, featuring their popular alternate identity and themed merchandise.
