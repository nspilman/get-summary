Central Maine Community College (CMCC) in Auburn has received a grant of $3.3 million to expand its health care training program. This congressionally directed spending aims to address the shortage of healthcare workers in the state by enabling the college to enroll more students into its programs. Specifically, the funding will be used to construct and equip a 7,200-square-foot addition to Kirk Hall, with the intention of training an additional 100 nurses annually. The expansion will also facilitate updates to science labs, improvements in the exercise science and physical fitness specialist programs, and enhancements to short-term workforce training in areas like medical assisting, certified nurse assisting, basic life support certification, and phlebotomy.

This move is expected to significantly contribute to the state's healthcare sector by enabling more Mainers to pursue high-demand, high-wage jobs in healthcare. CMCC, which is recognized for educating students who predominantly remain within the state, aims to further this trend through the Healthcare Training Expansion Project. Construction is anticipated to start early next year, with the projected opening date in fall 2026. CMCC is ranked No. 10 among Maineâ€™s largest colleges and universities based on its 2023 full-time undergraduate enrollment.
