Congress has approved $42 million for upgrades at 11 Maine hospitals and health centers, including a $5 million allocation for Mount Desert Island Hospital in Bar Harbor to renovate, expand, and add equipment to its emergency department. The funding, part of the current Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Bill signed into law, reflects U.S. Senator Susan Collins' advocacy and her key role as vice chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Projects funded include construction and equipment for new health centers, improvements in safety and accessibility at existing facilities, the purchase and installation of a new MRI machine, air quality control system enhancements, support for an improved electronic medical records platform, and emergency department expansions.
