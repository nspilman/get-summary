Senechal-Jandreau, who has been with New Ventures Maine in Aroostook County since 1997 in various positions such as center coordinator, regional manager, and recently as statewide workforce development manager, will now oversee the development and evaluation of programs in career development, small business and financial literacy, as well as manage statewide services and partnerships.
