The article discusses the significant rise in condominium prices in Portland, Maine, in 2023. According to Vitalius Real Estate Group's annual Condo Report, on the peninsula, the average sales price of condominiums increased by 26%, while off-peninsula prices rose by 9%. The analysis includes various types of transactions such as second home sales, new construction, divorce sales, and estate sales. The report, now in its 11th year, provides insights into current market conditions, inventory, new development, and forecasts for condo sales in the coming year.

Key takeaways from the report include a relatively stable number of condos sold but a notable increase in existing condo prices by 9%. New constructions saw an impressive value increase of 33% on a square foot basis, with average downtown prices jumping 19% per square foot, attributed to larger developments entering the market. Off-peninsula condos experienced a more moderate rise of 6% per square foot. The report also highlights the impact of higher interest rates on sales and the prevailing market challenge of constrained inventory, as owners with low-interest rate mortgages are hesitant to sell.

Cash buyers, particularly those investing over $500,000, dominate the market, likely benefiting from a strong stock market. Despite the overall market upswing, not all new condos sold out, with some developments facing sales challenges, possibly due to location and pricing issues. Successful projects like the over-55 community Stevens Square, which has sold out and is planning additional phases, contrast with these challenges. The report also mentions Dougherty Commons, a new income-restricted condo project, as an upcoming development.

Looking forward, the report anticipates steady values for existing condo sales and a continued rise in new construction prices due to low inventory and high demand at the upper end of the market. It also predicts sustained interest from out-of-state buyers and an optimistic outlook for mortgage rates potentially dropping further into 2025, although many purchases will likely still be made in cash.
