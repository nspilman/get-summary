Two scientific research institutions in Bar Harbor, the Jackson Laboratory and MDI Biological Laboratory, have been approved for a total of $9.6 million in funding. This financial support is part of the FY24 Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Bill.

**Jackson Laboratory** is set to receive $8 million to construct a modern facility dedicated to researching rare diseases and developing new therapies. Collaborating with Ohio’s Nationwide Children’s Hospital, the lab is notably working on a gene therapy for PGAP3-congenital disorder of glycosylation, which currently affects just 65 people globally. The establishment of Jackson Laboratory's Rare Disease Translational Center aims to provide an efficient route from diagnosis to therapy for patients, enabling them to lead healthier lives.

**MDI Biological Laboratory** will receive $1.6 million to enhance and expand its research capabilities. For 125 years, the nonprofit lab has been pioneering new methods in regenerative medicine, primarily focusing on identifying ways to repair and regenerate damaged tissues, organs, and limbs by studying organisms like zebrafish and salamanders. This project includes constructing additional space and acquiring lab equipment to develop emerging drug discovery technologies, potentially leading to the creation of more effective medicines with fewer side effects.
