The article discusses Elite Airways' decision to expand its flight services from Portland to include direct flights to Bar Harbor and Long Island, New York. This expansion, set to begin on June 17, will offer flights on Fridays and Sundays directly to Long Island MacArthur Airport with options for connecting flights to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and Orlando-Melbourne in central Florida. The decision for this expansion was influenced by the high interest in Bar Harbor and Acadia National Park as tourist destinations. Ticket prices for round-trip flights from Portland will range between $198 and $398 for Long Island and between $158 and $298 for Bar Harbor.
