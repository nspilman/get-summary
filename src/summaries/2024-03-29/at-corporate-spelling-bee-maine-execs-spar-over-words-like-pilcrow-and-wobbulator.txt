In Portland, the Corporate Spelling Bee held by the Maine Trust for Local News ended with Jessica Estes, president of the Boulos Co., winning against Jacqueline Edmondson, president of the University of Southern Maine. The event took place at Oxbow Brewing and featured 15 participants, raising funds for charity. Each participant pledged a $150 donation to the winnerâ€™s chosen charity, with Estes playing for LearningWorks and Edmondson for the University of Southern Maine Scholarship Fund. The winning word was "pilcrow." The event also had a donation jar at the entrance. Estes, who admitted to not having a degree and facing a college president in the final round, managed to win in her second attempt with the word "pilcrow," after her first try was incorrect. She aimed to support LearningWorks, a charity working with at-risk teens, through her participation. This victory dethroned Michael Bourque, CEO of the MEMIC Group, the two-time reigning champion, who lost on the word "wobbulator." The spelling bee not only served as a fundraiser but also as a networking event for Portland businesspeople, highlighting the importance of community support and charity.
