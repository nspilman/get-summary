The Hannaford supermarket in Gardiner, Maine, has reopened more than three months after being forced to close due to extensive damage from flood surge caused by a powerful storm on December 18. The store, located near the Kennebec River, has undergone repairs and is now equipped with temporary fixtures, which will be replaced with permanent ones in the coming months. Despite the changes, the supermarket aims to offer the same range of fresh food, household products, services, and a pharmacy to its customers. As part of its reopening, Hannaford has introduced nine additional self-checkouts, bringing the total to eleven, and plans to add a hot bar and fresh pizza offerings soon. To mark the reopening, Hannaford has donated $5,000 to two local food pantries in support of hunger relief efforts in the Gardiner community. The store plays a significant role in the city, and its quick reopening reflects the strong support from associates, community members, and the City of Gardiner itself. The December storm, known as the "Grinch storm," caused significant flooding, power outages, and damage across Maine one week before Christmas. The Hannaford store in Gardiner employs about 180 people, with only a handful not returning to their jobs after the flooding. Hannaford Supermarkets operates 187 stores across Maine, New York, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont, employing nearly 30,000 people and is a subsidiary of the Dutch retail conglomerate Ahold Delhaize.
