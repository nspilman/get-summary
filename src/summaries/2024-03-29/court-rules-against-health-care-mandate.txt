The article discusses a significant legal decision where a federal appeals court ruled against the mandate, a key component of the federal health care law, that requires all Americans to buy health insurance. The ruling came from the Atlanta-based 11th Circuit Court of Appeals with a 2-1 decision, siding with 26 states, including Maine, who challenged the legality of the reform. The court disagreed with a previous ruling that suggested the entire law should be voided, specifying instead that just the insurance mandate was unconstitutional, not the entirety of the law. The Obama administration was given the opportunity to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. Maine's Governor, Paul LePage, applauded the court's decision, viewing it as a victory for states' rights and individual liberties under the U.S. Constitution. This ruling sets the stage for a potential assessment by the Supreme Court, anticipated to possibly occur early the following year.
