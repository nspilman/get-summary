The Portland Sea Dogs, a Double-A affiliate of the Boston Red Sox, are partnering with Aira, a mobile app designed to assist visually impaired fans, to enhance their game-day experience at Hadlock Field. Aira provides on-demand, remote visual interpretation services by combining artificial intelligence with human intelligence to help users navigate physical and digital spaces. This will enable visually impaired fans to more easily find their way around the stadium, such as identifying shorter lines for food or locating restrooms. This initiative marks a significant milestone as it represents the first time a professional sports team has made such a service available at their stadium, setting a precedent for accessibility in sports venues worldwide. The service, which is free for blind and low-vision visitors to Hadlock Field, will be operational starting from the season opener against the Hartford Yard Goats on April 5. This move is applauded by organizations and individuals advocating for better accessibility and inclusion for people with disabilities in outdoor and recreational activities.
