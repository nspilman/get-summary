The article discusses the efforts led by U.S. Senator Susan Collins from Maine to prevent the reclassification of potatoes as a grain in the official Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Collins, along with Senator Michael Bennett from Colorado and a bipartisan group of 14 senators, expressed their concerns in a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Thomas Vilsack. They argue that reclassifying potatoes as a grain would cause confusion among consumers, retailers, restaurant operators, growers, and the entire supply chain. Additionally, they note that potatoes provide essential nutrients not found in grains, such as potassium, calcium, vitamin C, vitamin B6, and fiber. The letter also highlights the economic impact of potato production in Maine, which contributes $540 million in annual sales and supports 6,100 jobs. The senators emphasize the importance of potatoes in meeting vegetable consumption requirements in schools affordably.
