In an effort to tackle the challenge of workforce housing shortages in Bar Harbor, Maine, Witham Family Hotels has inaugurated an 84-bed dormitory designed to accommodate seasonal employees. Unveiled on 39 Kebo St., this 17,150-square-foot facility is equipped with eight kitchens, 23 bathrooms with showers, and laundry amenities spread across three floors and a basement. The initiative, a first of its kind for Bar Harbor, was conceived by David Witham, the hotel chain's managing partner and CEO, who recognized the impact of seasonal housing shortages on local neighborhoods. The project emerged following an amendment to the zoning ordinance approved by voters, allowing the construction of employee dormitories. Witham's engagement in the amendment's planning underscores a proactive approach to address the housing crisis, exacerbated by the conversion of units into vacation rentals. This facility not only aims to provide much-needed housing for seasonal workers but also opens up Witham's previously seasonal housing stock for year-round residential use, as already evidenced by three families moving into such accommodations. This endeavor not only eases the commute for employees like Jermel McWhorter, making family time more attainable, but also serves as a model for addressing the significant housing needs in Bar Harbor and across Maine.
