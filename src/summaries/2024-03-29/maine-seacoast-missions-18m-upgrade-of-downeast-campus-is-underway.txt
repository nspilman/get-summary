The Maine Seacoast Mission has initiated renovations and construction projects totaling $1.8 million on their 63-acre Downeast campus located in Cherryfield, with an open house for the first phase scheduled for June 12. This effort is supported by a completed capital campaign. The mission is known for delivering services across several islands with their vessel, Sunbeam, and aims to further enforce its presence in Washington County through these upgrades.

The first phase involves the complete renovation and expansion of a primary building into an "engagement center," comprising an administrative wing, a program staging area, and a new food pantry — improvements that are expected to finish by spring. This pantry is designed with expanded storage and will include a community space for healthy living programs. In 2021, this food pantry supported 2,033 people from 784 households monthly, distributing 63,000 pounds of food. Additionally, an education center on site offers more than 1,900 hours of educational programming to seven schools and over 500 families.

The project’s second phase is also underway, focusing on constructing a new pole-based challenge course and retreat cabins near the Weald Bethel Community Center. These enhancements aim to replace an older ropes course and allow the mission to act as a hub for day-long and overnight retreats for partners, housing improvement volunteers, and youth. Furthermore, plans include updating the campus trail system, introducing new play areas and a gazebo, and establishing new pedestrian paths.

The campaign's success was supported by contributions from various donors, including Connie and Buddy Bates, Roger and Judy Clapp, and the Diana Davis Spencer Foundation, among others.
