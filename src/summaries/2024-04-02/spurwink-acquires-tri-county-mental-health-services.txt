Spurwink, a nonprofit behavioral health care provider, has acquired Tri-County Mental Health Services, another nonprofit provider based in Lewiston. The acquisition aims to ensure uninterrupted services for people with mental health and substance use needs in Androscoggin, Franklin, Oxford, and northern Cumberland counties. The leadership of both organizations is focused on maintaining employment options and service continuation during the transition. Spurwink's president and CEO expressed commitment to upholding the legacy of mental health services in western Maine and highlighted the alignment between the two organizations' missions for the benefit of the community. The majority of services will remain unchanged after the acquisition, with a strong emphasis on maintaining continuity of care for clients.
