The article discusses the Maine Turnpike Authority's plan to connect the highway to the town of Gorham through a proposed turnpike spur known as the Gorham Connector. The project aims to alleviate traffic congestion on local streets and back roads due to rapid suburban growth and increased businesses. The proposed spur would run nearly 5 miles between Exit 45 in South Portland and the Gorham Bypass junction in Gorham, an initiative supported by various municipalities. However, objections have been raised by some residents, particularly concerning a segment that might traverse through the Smiling Hill family farm in Westbrook. The project's impact extends beyond the local area, potentially influencing southern Maine and the relationship between Mainers and the Turnpike Authority.
