U.S. Senator Angus King, alongside a bipartisan group of lawmakers, is challenging new European Union rules on forest goods, known as the European Union Deforestation-Free Regulation, set to be enforced from the start of 2025. This regulation mandates due diligence for exporters of pulp and paper products to the EU, to ensure that the EU’s consumption doesn’t contribute to deforestation. King and the lawmakers argue that these new requirements might adversely affect the $350 billion U.S. paper and pulp industry, which supports over 920,000 American jobs, including many in Maine where the timber industry is crucial. The legislators are concerned about the rules’ ambiguity and the potential for disrupting the existing relationships between producers and landowners due to the requirement of tracing commodities back to their specific land of origin and identifying landowners. They have made appeals to the U.S. Trade Representative for clarification and adjustments to the rule to ensure that American producers can comply without jeopardizing the trade relationship between the United States and the European Union.
