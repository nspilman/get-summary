The city of Lewiston has collaborated with the Lewiston Auburn Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce to initiate the OneLewiston Resilience Fund. This initiative aims to construct a memorial honoring the victims of Maine's deadliest mass shooting that took place on October 25, killing 18 people and injuring 13. To begin fundraising efforts, a special event, the Healing Hearts Gala, is planned for March 29 at the Hilton Garden Inn in Auburn, featuring live music, a silent auction, and more. The design and implementation of the memorial will be overseen by a planning committee, including victims' families, survivors, and community representatives, with the goal of creating a meaningful memorial and unifying events to help the community move forward from the tragedy.
