A new sandwich shop, Vina Ann’s, is set to open in a tiny 77-square-foot waterfront gazebo on Portland's Commercial Street. The shop, owned by Liz Tavares and Hannah Maltby, will offer a variety of sandwiches, salads, and classic Maine desserts such as whoopie pies and blueberry pies. The food will be prepared in a commercial kitchen located on Forest Avenue. Vina Ann’s will emphasize the use of Maine products, including Maine Root sodas, and operate from mid-June to October. The venture, named after the owners' mothers, started in fall 2020 during the pandemic as a pop-up bakery in honor of their late mothers.
