Polymer Laboratories and Solutions LLC, also known as Poly Labs, has sold its 93,500-square-foot facility in Lewiston, Maine, to an out-of-state investor. The property, located at 765 Webster St., was sold for $6.1 million. Despite the sale, Poly Labs will continue to operate in the building under a long-term, absolute, triple-net lease, meaning they are responsible for property expenses such as insurance, taxes, and maintenance. The sale allows Poly Labs to reinvest the proceeds into other business areas. Poly Labs specializes in manufacturing polyurethane components for various applications including defense and medical sectors, and has experienced significant growth since its acquisition and rebranding in late 2020.
