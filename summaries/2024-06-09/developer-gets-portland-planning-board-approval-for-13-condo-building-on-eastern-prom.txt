A new 13-condo building with a 15-car parking garage has received site plan approval from the Portland Planning Board. The development, managed by ECK Realty LLC and represented by Greg Shinberg, is located at 246 Eastern Promenade in Portland and believed to be the first new housing on the Eastern Prom in decades. Carol A. Morrissette of RDS Architects designed the building, which will replace an existing home. Pre-construction services and likely the main construction will be handled by New Hampshire-based DeStefano & Associates.
