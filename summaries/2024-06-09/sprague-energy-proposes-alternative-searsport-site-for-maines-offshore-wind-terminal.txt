Sprague Operating Resources LLC is proposing an alternative site for Maine's offshore wind energy port at its Mack Point Terminal, near Sears Island. The state's original plan, part of the Maine Offshore Wind Roadmap, involves developing a $500 million port on 100 acres at Sears Island. Sprague's alternative, highlighted for its reduced environmental impact and cost, suggests utilizing 100 acres at Mack Point, preserving current operations and minimizing dredging and wetland impact. Sprague's terminal, operational since 1905, offers extensive dock space and existing infrastructure, potentially reducing development costs and permitting delays. Environmentalists oppose the state's plan due to its potential impact on Sears Island's conserved land.
