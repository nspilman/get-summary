Portland is nearing the completion of a $55 million cold-storage warehouse on the waterfront, anticipated to be operational early 2025. The 107,000-square-foot facility will handle temperature-sensitive cargo including food, agricultural products, and biopharmaceuticals. Developed by a consortium consisting of Amber Infrastructure North America, Treadwell Franklin Infrastructure, and Eimskip, the facility faced delays due to COVID-19-related supply chain issues but maintained its budget. Taylor Logistics Inc. will manage the warehouse operations, and businesses interested in utilizing the space are encouraged to contact the consortium.
