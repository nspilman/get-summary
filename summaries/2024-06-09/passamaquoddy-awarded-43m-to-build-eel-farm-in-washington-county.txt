The Passamaquoddy Tribe at Indian Township has been awarded a $4.3 million grant from the USDA's Indigenous Animals Harvesting and Meat Processing grant program. This funding will be used to develop an eel-growing farm in Princeton, Washington County, Maine, in partnership with American Unagi Inc., a company specializing in American eel production and processing. The project aims to create jobs, offer economic benefits to the tribe, and provide a sustainable alternative to wild harvesting, thereby supporting cultural practices and economic independence.
