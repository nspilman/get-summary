Maine Medical Center is nearing the completion of its $378 million Malone Family Tower, with the 300,000-square-foot, eight-story expansion set to open to patients on June 9. This addition includes 96 private patient rooms, 32 intensive care units, 10 operating rooms, and nine procedure rooms, enhancing the hospital's capacity to provide cardiac and cardiovascular care. The project incorporates sustainable features like a "green roof," and aims for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver Certification. Funding for the tower came from various sources, including a $25 million donation from John and Leslie Malone. The expansion is part of a broader $588.4 million project initiated in 2018, which also included additional hospital facilities and parking expansions.
