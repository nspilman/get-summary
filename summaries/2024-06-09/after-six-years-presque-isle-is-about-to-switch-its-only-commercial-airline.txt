JetBlue Airways will replace United Airlines as the federally contracted air carrier at Presque Isle International Airport (PQI) in Maine, starting September 1, 2024. This switch follows a decision by the U.S. Department of Transportation, under its Essential Air Service (EAS) program, which subsidizes flights to remote areas. JetBlue, operating with larger aircraft but offering fewer daily flights, will connect PQI to Boston's Logan International Airport instead of Newark Liberty International Airport. United, which had served PQI since 2018, was outbid by JetBlue, which proposed lower federal subsidies for the upcoming contract period.
