A delegation of 15 aquaculture and fisheries experts from Maine will visit Hokkaido, Japan, from June 9-14, to study the Japanese wild and farm-raised kelp industry. The visit aims to learn from Japan's well-established industry to help Maine's young kelp farming sector. The delegation, organized by Coastal Enterprises Inc., includes key stakeholders from Atlantic Sea Farms and other kelp businesses. They will engage with Japanese kelp growers, processors, retailers, scientists, and fishermen to gain insights on scaling Maine's kelp industry sustainably.
