Maine Medical Center in Portland and Southern Maine Health Care in Biddeford and Sanford have completed their integration, forming a unified medical center under the MaineHealth system. This merger combines their hospital licenses and medical staffs into MaineHealth Maine Medical Center, with three main campuses: Portland, Biddeford, and Sanford.

The integration aims to enhance resource usage, share clinical expertise, ensure a consistent patient experience, and provide new training opportunities. MaineHealth plans to add 62 new residency and fellowship slots across various medical disciplines between July and 2027 to address the physician shortage, especially in rural areas.
