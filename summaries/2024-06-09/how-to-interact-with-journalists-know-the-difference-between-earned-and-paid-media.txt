Nancy Marshall from Marshall Communications has written an article on how to effectively interact with journalists, particularly for those in public relations. The article emphasizes the distinction between "earned media," which involves securing news coverage through compelling story pitches, and "paid media," which refers to advertising. Marshall offers best practices for dealing with journalists, such as responding promptly to queries, understanding deadlines, and knowing whether the information provided should be "on the record" or "on background." The article also advises against excessive follow-up and stresses the importance of understanding a journalist's past coverage to better tailor pitches. The goal is to build a trustworthy relationship with journalists by providing useful and timely information.
