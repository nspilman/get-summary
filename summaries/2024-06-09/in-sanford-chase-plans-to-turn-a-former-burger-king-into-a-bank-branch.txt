JPMorgan Chase & Co. plans to open a new bank branch in Sanford, Maine, at the former location of a Burger King restaurant on the corner of Main Street and Alumni Boulevard. This follows the opening of their sixth branch in Scarborough earlier in the week. The Sanford branch is anticipated to open in the second quarter of 2025. Chase has progressively expanded its presence in Maine, starting with a commercial team in 2018 and opening its first retail branch in Portland in 2021. The bank aims to contribute to local economic growth and meet the needs of local consumers and small businesses.
