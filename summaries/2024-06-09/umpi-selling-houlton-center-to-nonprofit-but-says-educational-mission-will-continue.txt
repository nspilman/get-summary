**Summary:**

The University of Maine at Presque Isle (UMPI) is set to sell the Houlton Higher Education Center to Community Living Association (CLA), a local nonprofit, for $525,000. The sale is expected to be completed by July 1. Despite the sale, UMPI will maintain a presence in the building by renting a 3,240-square-foot space for classrooms, offices, and a computer lab for $1 per year. The facility, which has been operational since 2001, has been struggling financially due to the rise in online learning. CLA will use the building for administration, conference, and classroom space, and will allow existing tenants to continue occupying their spaces while also hosting various community events.
