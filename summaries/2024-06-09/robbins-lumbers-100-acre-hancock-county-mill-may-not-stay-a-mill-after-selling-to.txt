Robbins Lumber Inc. has sold its 100-acre mill complex in Hancock County, Maine, to contractor Elliott Jordan & Sons Inc. for $2.5 million. The buyer, based in Waltham and led by Duane Jordan and his sons, may not use the site as a mill but sees potential for redevelopment over the coming years. The property, marketed as a redevelopment opportunity, features 108,655 square feet of space across 22 buildings. Robbins Lumber, a major Eastern white pine producer, decided to sell following a critical equipment failure at the Hancock plant. The new owners plan to collaborate with local officials to determine the best use for the property.
