Governor Janet Mills emphasized the need for more workers in Maine to sustain economic growth during a conference in Portland. While noting that approximately 13,400 new workers have joined Maine’s workforce over the past three years, Mills pointed out that continued economic growth outstrips the available workforce. She highlighted the importance of attracting local and international workers and supporting them through investments in high-speed broadband, affordable health care, and accessible childcare. Mills also stressed the significant contributions of immigrants to Maine’s workforce and the state’s efforts to expedite federal work authorizations. Economic indicators such as a nearly 2% GDP growth in 2023 and positive international migration underscore the state's attractiveness despite challenges such as affordable housing shortages. The conference included discussions with various business leaders and experts on maximizing the potential of diverse talents in Maine.
