The Maine seafood industry is establishing a promotional council to enhance its market presence and support economic growth. Spearheaded by FocusMaine and funded by the Department of Economic and Community Development, this council aims to increase industry revenues by 10% and add 1,000 jobs by 2030. Andrea Cianchette Maker, FocusMaine’s president, highlighted the need to utilize both traditional and new aquaculture expertise. The council's two-year pilot phase includes hosting awareness events and leveraging existing marketing resources. The initiative, part of the Roadmap for the Future of Maine’s Seafood Economy, seeks to bolster Maine's food economy and support local fisheries.
