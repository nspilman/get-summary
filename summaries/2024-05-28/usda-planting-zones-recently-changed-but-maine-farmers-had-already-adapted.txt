The article discusses the recent update to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's plant hardiness map, which indicates a warmer shift in Maine's coldest minimum temperatures. This change, observed since the last update in 2012, reflects a gradual increase in temperatures due to climate change. Maine farmers have noted these changes, which have affected their crops, with increased variability in weather patterns, such as unusual heat and damaging cold snaps. For example, Shane Patrick of Pleasant Pond Orchard reports losing most of his apple harvest due to such unpredictable weather. The warming trend has also complicated traditional farming methods, prompting some farmers to adopt protective growing techniques like greenhouse cultivation. These adaptations, while necessary, come with significant costs, which are challenging for farmers to bear alone. The updated map serves as a crucial confirmation for many farmers of the ongoing climate shifts they have been experiencing.
