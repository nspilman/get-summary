Nexus Maine, a virtual community established on Slack, has attracted over 300 members including entrepreneurs and remote workers. The platform, created by Jimmy Haight and George Matelich, aims to serve as a virtual coffee shop where professionals can connect, share ideas, and seek advice. Nexus Maine recently hosted an event at Cloudport Coworking in Portland, which had an unexpectedly high turnout of around 50 attendees. The group offers various channels for members to communicate, a newsletter, and an events calendar, with plans to potentially introduce a podcast or ticketed events in the future. The founders emphasize community building and do not intend to compete with in-person networking events hosted by organizations like Startup Maine.
