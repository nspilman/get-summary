General Dynamics Bath Iron Works (BIW) successfully demonstrated the operational capabilities of the U.S. Navy destroyer John Basilone (DDG 122) during acceptance trials in the Gulf of Maine. The ship exhibited its hull, mechanical, and electrical systems for the Navyâ€™s Board of Inspection and Survey. The John Basilone is part of the Arleigh Burke class of guided missile destroyers, known for multi-mission offensive and defensive capabilities and reduced radar cross-section. Named for Medal of Honor recipient Gunnery Sgt. John Basilone, BIW continues to build more Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, including the technologically advanced Flight III variants with enhanced radar systems. BIW is a major employer in Maine with substantial economic impact, supporting over $1.8 billion in total economic output in 2021.
