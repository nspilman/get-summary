Amber Lambke, CEO and co-founder of Maine Grains in Skowhegan, is spearheading a significant expansion of the company’s facilities to create a food-centered community space. Situated in a repurposed 14,000-square-foot former prison, the Maine Grains building hosts various businesses, including a café, a retail store, and an artisan cheesemaker. Lambke’s expansion project, on an adjacent vacant lot, aims to house a year-round Skowhegan Farmers' Market, administrative offices, grain packaging operations, and rental space for entrepreneurs, among other amenities. Maine Grains, established in 2012 with Michael Scholz, sources organic and heritage grains from local farms and contributes significantly to the local economy. The expansion, planned despite challenges such as inflation and high construction costs, has secured initial funding from the USDA and private donors. Lambke continues to seek additional funding to bring the project to fruition, emphasizing community building and addressing food insecurity in Skowhegan.
