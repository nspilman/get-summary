The article by Carrie Green Yardley discusses whether all business agreements need to be in writing. While verbal agreements can be enforced, there are certain contracts that must legally be documented in writing due to the statute of frauds, which originated in 1677. This statute mandates written proof for contracts involving significant transactions such as estate debts, guarantees, real estate interests, and contracts lasting more than a year. Modern statutes of frauds extend these requirements, emphasizing the importance of having written agreements to avoid disputes. The article concludes that documenting agreements is crucial to ensure clear and reliable proof, especially in complex or financially significant transactions.
