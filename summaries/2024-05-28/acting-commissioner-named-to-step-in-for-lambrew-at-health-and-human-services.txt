Just a week before Jeanne Lambrew's scheduled departure from Maine’s Department of Health and Human Services, Governor Janet Mills has appointed Sara Gagné-Holmes as the acting commissioner. Gagné-Holmes has served as deputy commissioner for over five years and will begin her interim role on June 1. Lambrew is leaving to assume a position at a think tank and to teach at Harvard University. Gagné-Holmes brings a strong background in health policy and has served in various leadership roles within the department and beyond. Governor Mills continues to search for a permanent commissioner, who will undergo a legislative hearing and confirmation process.
