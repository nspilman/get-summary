Jersey Mike’s Subs is expanding its presence in Maine with its 10th location set to open on May 29 in Falmouth, at 240 U.S. Route 1. The new store will be situated in a former Olympia Sports location. Jersey Mike’s, known for its fresh-sliced and fresh-grilled subs on freshly baked bread, has over 3,000 outlets nationwide. The Falmouth location, owned by Chris Brown, will celebrate the opening with a charitable event, donating 100% of the day’s sales to Falmouth Elementary School. This aligns with Jersey Mike’s core value of community involvement. Orders can be placed in-store, or through the Jersey Mike’s app, with options for curbside pickup and delivery via third-party partners.
