Maine Audubon has partnered with the University of Southern Maine and the Portland Society for Architecture to promote bird-safe architecture through BirdSafe Maine. This initiative raises awareness about the problem of birds flying into windows and promotes solutions to reduce these incidents. Companies like L.L. Bean and MEMIC have installed bird-safe decals, achieving significant reductions in bird strikes. BirdSafe Maine has also recognized schools, universities, and design professionals for implementing bird-safe practices. The initiative highlights various strategies like UV materials and decals to make glass more visible to birds, aiming to prevent up to 1 billion bird deaths annually in the U.S. Legislative efforts, like the passage of LD 670, are enhancing statewide bird protection in public building construction.
