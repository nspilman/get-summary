Kittery-based startup Pumpspotting, led by founder and CEO Amy VanHaren, is launching its third "Breast Express" bus tour this summer. This refurbished 2010 Blue Bird school bus will travel to over a dozen cities from July to October, offering a mobile space for nursing, pumping, feeding, and parenting support. The initiative aims to improve maternal health outcomes and boost baby-feeding confidence by fostering community. The tour kicks off at Allagash Brewing Co. in Portland on July 18, featuring amenities like a lounge, kitchen, self-care station, and consultation space for parents to meet with lactation consultants and try various baby-feeding products.
